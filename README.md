# Addressing Membership Challenges: Insights and Strategies for Amour Beauty Box

Erdos UX Research - Spring 2025 - A/B testing

<b>Objective:</b>

Amour Beauty Box is a makeup company that offers membership-based services. Over the past three business quarters, Amour Beauty Box has been experiencing declining sign-ups but minimal cancellations, which suggests current members are satisfied, but the company is struggling to attract new customers. To determine whether internal or external factors cause this trend, we have proposed conducting A/B testing. As part of this process, we recommend surveying customers to gather insights.
